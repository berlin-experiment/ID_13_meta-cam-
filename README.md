Audio Presence Within A VR Environment

For the semester I focuesed on how the real world campus has certain sounds and audio ambience that gives it life and add to the idea of it being an authentic experience. While live streaming the audio into the meta campus would be an esy solution, it does pose some challenges; issues of privacy, placement of audio equipment required, and the high chance that it just sounds like a muffled mess when it is busy I feel prerecorded audio clips, overlayed to mimic the real world back noise would be best.

Factors to consider when selecting the sound clips and audio layering of the loops:

- Time of day
- Which rooms and how is the room normally used
- The amount of traffic the room/area gets (People + Pets)
- What equipment is in the room and how does it sound; instruments or tools
- Current number of people in the room

My idea is if we prerecorded sounds at the campus in isolation, edited them appropriately, and create audio loops that can be layered - this might make more sense later or might not - to replicate the ambient sounds of CODE. I would have small cameras in certain parts of the campus and use object detection to pick up how many people are in a room:

- If two people are in the kitchen area, the loop layers would be fridge humming, soft keyboard noises, and soft indistinguishable conversation.
- If 7 people are in the area, the loop layer would be slightly louder indistinguishable conversation and laughter, the occasional sound of cups placed on counters, maybe if a cam is by the piano, for example, some piano can be played.
- Or something like this to set the scene of each room and link the virtual campus to the real one through sound.

Object detection will be use to see how many people are in a given room, take into account the time of day and play the appropriate layers and combinations for the situation.
